# Analysing-Data-Bootcamp
This repository contains my final work-based project for a 12-week Bootcamp in Analysing Data  that I attended.

In this bootcamp, I developed a level 3 equivalent skill set in data literacy, analysing, interpreting and presenting data with Microsoft Excel and Power BI.

This project is aimed at understanding the relationship between loan distribution and socio-economic factors. To understand this relationship, two types of analysis will be carried out:
1.	Exploratory analysis 
-	To explore loan distribution across graduate status, income levels, and property area
-	To explore credit history across dependants.
2.	Predictive analysis 
-	To predict loan status and amounts based on income, property area and/or dependants


In this project, I performed predictive and exploratory analysis using Orange, Microsoft Excel, Python 3 and Power BI, to provide recommendations for improving marketing and financial goods and services rendered to a bankâ€™s customers. I created an interactive dashboard on Microsoft Excel to present my work.
