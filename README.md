# Analysing-Data-Bootcamp
This repository contains my final work-based project for a 12-week Bootcamp in Analysing Data  that I attended.

In this bootcamp, I developed a level 3 equivalent skill set in data literacy, analysing, interpreting and presenting data with Microsoft Excel and Power BI.
In this project, I performed predictive and exploratory analysis using Orange, Microsoft Excel, Python 3 and Power BI, to provide recommendations for improving marketing and financial goods and services rendered to a bankâ€™s customers. I created an interactive dashboard on Microsoft Excel to present my work.
